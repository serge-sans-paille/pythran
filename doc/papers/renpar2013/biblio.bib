  abstract	= {Although the C-based interpreter of Python is reasonably
		  fast, implementations on the CLI or the JVM platforms
		  offers some advantages in terms of robustness and
		  interoperability. Unfortunately, because the CLI and JVM
		  are primarily designed to execute statically typed,
		  object-oriented languages, most dynamic language
		  implementations cannot use the native bytecodes for common
		  operations like method calls and exception handling; as a
		  result, they are not able to take full advantage of the
		  power offered by the CLI and JVM. We describe a different
		  approach that attempts to preserve the flexibility of
		  Python, while still allowing for efficient execution. This
		  is achieved by limiting the use of the more dynamic
		  features of Python to an initial, bootstrapping phase. This
		  phase is used to construct a final RPython (Restricted
		  Python) program that is actually executed. RPython is a
		  proper subset of Python, is statically typed, and does not
		  allow dynamic modification of class or method definitions;
		  however, it can still take advantage of Python features
		  such as mixins and first-class methods and classes. This
		  paper presents an overview of RPython, including its design
		  and its translation to both CLI and JVM bytecode. We show
		  how the bootstrapping phase can be used to implement
		  advanced features, like extensible classes and generative
		  programming. We also discuss what work remains before
		  RPython is truly ready for general use, and compare the
		  performance of RPython with that of other approaches.},
