  abstract =     "Although the C-based interpreter of Python is
                 reasonably fast, implementations on the CLI or the JVM
                 platforms offers some advantages in terms of robustness
                 and interoperability. Unfortunately, because the CLI
                 and JVM are primarily designed to execute statically
                 typed, object-oriented languages, most dynamic language
                 implementations cannot use the native bytecodes for
                 common operations like method calls and exception
                 handling; as a result, they are not able to take full
                 advantage of the power offered by the CLI and JVM. We
                 describe a different approach that attempts to preserve
                 the flexibility of Python, while still allowing for
                 efficient execution. This is achieved by limiting the
                 use of the more dynamic features of Python to an
                 initial, bootstrapping phase. This phase is used to
                 construct a final RPython (Restricted Python) program
                 that is actually executed. RPython is a proper subset
                 of Python, is statically typed, and does not allow
                 dynamic modification of class or method definitions;
                 however, it can still take advantage of Python features
                 such as mixins and first-class methods and classes.
                 This paper presents an overview of RPython, including
                 its design and its translation to both CLI and JVM
                 bytecode. We show how the bootstrapping phase can be
                 used to implement advanced features, like extensible
                 classes and generative programming. We also discuss
                 what work remains before RPython is truly ready for
                 general use, and compare the performance of RPython
                 with that of other approaches.",
