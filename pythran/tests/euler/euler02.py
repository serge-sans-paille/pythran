    '''
    Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
    
    1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
    
    Find the sum of all the even-valued terms in the sequence which do not exceed four million.
