    It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.
    
     9 =  7 + 2 x 1^2
    15 =  7 + 2 x 2^2
    21 =  3 + 2 x 3^2
    25 =  7 + 2 x 3^2
    27 = 19 + 2 x 2^2
    33 = 31 + 2 x 1^2
    It turns out that the conjecture was false.
    
    What is the smallest odd composite that cannot be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square?
