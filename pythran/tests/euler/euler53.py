    There are exactly ten ways of selecting three from five, 12345:
    
    123, 124, 125, 134, 135, 145, 234, 235, 245, and 345
    
    In combinatorics, we use the notation, 5C3 = 10.
    
    In general,
    
    nCr = n! / r!(nr)! where r <= n, n! = n x (n-1)...x 3 x 2 x 1, and 0! = 1.
    
    It is not until n = 23, that a value exceeds one-million: 23C10 = 1144066.
    
    How many, not necessarily distinct, values of  nCr, for 1 <= n <= 100, are greater than one-million?
