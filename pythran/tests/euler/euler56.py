    A googol (10^100) is a massive number: one followed by one-hundred zeros; 100^100 is almost unimaginably large: one followed by two-hundred zeros. Despite their size, the sum of the digits in each number is only 1.
    
    Considering natural numbers of the form, a^b, where a, b < 100, what is the maximum digital sum?

    max = 0
    for a in xrange(0, 100):
        for b in xrange(0, 100):
            ds = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(long(a)**b))
            if ds > max: max = ds
    return max
