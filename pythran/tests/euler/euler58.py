    Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, a square spiral with side length 7 is formed.

    38 17 16 15 14 13 30

    40 19  6  1  2 11 28

    42 21 22 23 24 25 26
    43 44 45 46 47 48 49
    
    It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right diagonal, but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 ~ 62%.
    
    If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral with side length 9 will be formed. If this process is continued, what is the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along both diagonals first falls below 10%?
